## Do I need an API key to use Layr?

No. Layr comes **pre-configured with Groq AI**, so you can start using it immediately after installation without adding any API keys or configuration.

---

## Which AI model does Layr use by default?

Layr uses **Groq AI powered by the Llama 3.3 70B model** by default. This provides ultra-fast and high-quality project planning directly inside VS Code.

---

## Can I use a different AI provider?

Yes. While Groq is enabled by default, Layr also supports **Gemini, OpenAI, and Claude** if you prefer another provider. These alternatives require you to supply your own API keys.

---

## Does Layr work offline?

No. Layr requires an active internet connection because it communicates with external AI services to generate project plans.

---

## Is my data sent to third parties?

Yes. Your project description is sent only to the configured AI provider (Groq by default) to generate a plan. Layr does not store, log, or sell your data.

---

## Can I customize the generated plan format?

Yes. You can customize plan output using Layr settings such as **Plan Size** and **Plan Type**. These options allow you to control detail level and project style.

---

## What languages or frameworks can Layr plan for?

Layr can generate plans for a wide range of technologies including frontend, backend, DevOps, mobile, and full-stack projects. The output depends on how you describe your project in the prompt.
